**Notes:**

The program *solve\_cap\_in\_a\_model\_file.py* reads the input model file *system\_n0.model*, solves the component allocation problem, and stores the optimal solution set in the output model file *solutionSet\_0.model*. The input meta-model file is *componentAllocation2.ecore* and the output meta-model file is *solutionSet.ecore*. This version of the program assumes a variable number of resources (i.e., the updated meta-model for the component allocation problem is used).
